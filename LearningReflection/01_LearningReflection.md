## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Executing the static tests for Gitlab webpages made me understand better the process of static testing.
Studying software testing from the books gives a good basic understanding what can and should be done.
Still, being "bookwise" is totally different thing than actual hands-on skills.

Executing and documenting the test cases systemically made me practically understand the importance of the process: systematic execution improves the reliability of testing, test cases can easily be repeated, comprehensive documentation of the work done strengthens stakeholders' trust for the product. If testing and documentation wasn't done this systemically, it would be much more unclear what has been done and how it actually was done.

It would be important to practise dynamic testing as well, but I guess that is main focus of the "Ohjelmistojen toiminnallinen testaus" course.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?
- Test suit template and log in page example included good instructions. I followed the instructors and
wrote test cases using Visual Studio Code. I executed test cases step by step and tried to documentate everything carefully.

For bug report I opend the webpage where the imaginary bug was
located. I inspected the web page using developers tools. This way I was able to study the written code, and found "the bug".
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management
 - This was my very first time executing static tests. I don't know any other tools or styles for test case
 management. From different IDE's that I have used, I like Visual Studio Code the most.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- Visual Studio Code


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I didn't find any trouble. Everything worked very well.

      

## 6. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other)
- I studied all the mentioned three framework from the internet. It seems that Cypress is easier to install and maintain compared to the other two. This makes Cypress an attractive candidate for a novice. It uses JavaScript which is fairly simple and much used language even for beginner. Also this could support the choice. Cypress only works in browser-based testing, which ofcourse sets boundaries for its use. 


## 7. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- I searched available tester jobd from the TE-services. I found a few interesting job advertisement. A thing that was common to almostg all jobs were that several years of work experience as a tester was desired. It seems that entry barriers are relatively high for software testers positions. I wasn't able to find any "junior tester" positions. Job descriptions in all available job advertisements included taking care of the whole testing life cycle: from planning the test to executing, solving the causes of defects to reporting.



## 8. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I would definitely need some concrete proof to be able to show my skills. Maybe an executed testing project,
where a team has built a testing environment ans used it for executing tests. It would be superb to have more hands-on experiences, so that I would feel comfortable to seek for a software testers career.


## 9. Are you going to apply for ISTQB Foundation level Certification?
- If the certification was included in the course, I definitely would. The certification is quite expensive
and is not that relevant for me at this moment.
